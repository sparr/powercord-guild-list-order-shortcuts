# Guild List Order Shortcuts

Adds context menu entries to re-order the server list (which Discord calls "Guilds" internally)

## Features

Move individual servers to the top or bottom of the list, or into a target folder by name.

Sort the entire server list alphabetically or by join date, with folders unsorted at the bottom for now.
